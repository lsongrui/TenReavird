# DrivAerNet
DrivAerNet: A Parametric Car Dataset for Data-driven Aerodynamic Design and Graph-Based Drag Prediction

## Introduction
DrivAerNet is a large-scale, high-fidelity CFD dataset of 3D industry-standard car shapes designed for data-driven aerodynamic design. It comprises 4000 high-quality 3D car meshes and their corresponding aerodynamic performance coefficients, alongside full 3D flow field information.


## Parametric Model 
The DrivAerNet dataset includes a parametric model of the DrivAer fastback, developed using ANSAÂ® software to enable extensive exploration of automotive design variations. This model is defined by 50 geometric parameters, allowing the generation of 4000 unique car designs through Optimal Latin Hypercube sampling and the Enhanced Stochastic Evolutionary Algorithm. 

DrivAerNet dataset incorporates a wide range of geometric modifications, including changes to side mirrors, muffler positions, windscreen and rear window dimensions, engine undercover size, front door and fender offsets, hood placement, headlight scale, overall car length and width, upper and underbody scaling, and key angles like the ramp, diffusor, and trunk lid angles, to thoroughly investigate their impacts on car aerodynamics.

## CFD Data
The DrivAerNet dataset provides comprehensive 3D flow field data, including detailed analyses of pressure and velocity fields along the $x$ and $y$ axes, as well as wall-shear stresses, contributing to a deeper understanding of aerodynamic forces. Additionally, it offers key aerodynamic metrics relevant to car geometries, such as the total moment coefficient $C_m$, drag coefficient $C_d$, lift coefficient $C_l$, front lift coefficient $C_{l,f}$, and rear lift coefficient $C_{l,r}$. The dataset also encompasses important parameters like wall-shear stress and the $y^{+}$ metric, essential for mesh quality evaluations, and insights into flow trajectories, enhancing the comprehension of aerodynamic interactions.

## RegDGCNN: Dynamic Graph Convolutional Neural Network for Regression Tasks
In this study, we adapt the Dynamic Graph Convolutional Neural Network (DGCNN) framework, traditionally used for classification tasks, to tackle regression problems, specifically predicting aerodynamic coefficients. Our RegDGCNN model integrates PointNet's spatial encoding with graph CNNs' relational analysis to understand fluid dynamics around objects. It employs edge convolution (EdgeConv) on dynamically updating graphs to capture fluid flow's intricate interactions, presenting a new approach for precise aerodynamic parameter estimation.

RegDGCNN utilizes the extensive DrivAerNet dataset to deliver accurate drag predictions directly from 3D meshes, overcoming conventional challenges like the requirement for 2D image rendering or Signed Distance Fields (SDF) generation.

## Computational Efficiency of RegDGCNN
RegDGCNN model is both lightweight, with just 3 million parameters and a 10MB size, and fast, estimating drag for a 540k mesh face car design in only 1.2 seconds on four A100 GPUs. This represents a significant reduction in computational time compared to the 2.3 hours required for a conventional CFD simulation on a system with 128 CPU cores.

## Effect of Training Dataset Size

<table>
<tr>
<td>

- DrivAerNet is 60% larger than the previously available largest public dataset of cars and is the only opensource dataset that also models wheels and underbody, allowing accurate estimation of drag.
- Within the DrivAerNet dataset, expanding the training set from 560 to 2800 car designs resulted in a 75% decrease in error. A similar trend is observed with the ShapeNet cars dataset, where enlarging the number of training samples from 1270 to 6352 entries yielded a 56% error reduction, further validating the inherent value of large datasets in driving advancements in surrogate modeling.
